## 🚀 **Railway Deployment Steps**

### **Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"

3. **Connect Repository**
   - Choose your repository: `LFRZ-Inc/Cooking-With-`
   - Select the `cooking-ethos-railway` directory

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
   - It will install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Start command: `gunicorn app:app`

### **Option 2: Fix Existing Railway Project**

If you have a failed Railway deployment:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Find your "Cooking Ethos AI" project
   - Click on the failed service

2. **Check Logs**
   - Look for error messages
   - Common issues:
     - Missing dependencies
     - Wrong start command
     - Port configuration issues

3. **Redeploy**
   - Click "Redeploy" or "Deploy"
   - Railway will use the latest code from GitHub

## 🔧 **Common Railway Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "gunicorn not found"**
**Solution**: Make sure `requirements.txt` includes:
```
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

### **Issue 2: "Port not found"**
**Solution**: Make sure `Procfile` contains:
```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

### **Issue 3: "Python version not supported"**
**Solution**: Make sure `runtime.txt` contains:
```
python-3.11.0
```

### **Issue 4: "Build failed"**
**Solution**: Check that all files are in the `cooking-ethos-railway` directory:
```
cooking-ethos-railway/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Procfile
├── runtime.txt
└── README.md
```

## 🌐 **After Successful Railway Deployment**

1. **Get the Deployment URL**
   - Railway will provide a URL like: `https://cooking-ethos-ai-production.up.railway.app`

2. **Test the Health Check**
   - Visit: `https://your-url/health`
   - Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "Cooking Ethos AI"}`

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Add to your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   COOKING_ETHOS_AI_URL=https://your-railway-url
   ```

4. **Test the Integration**
   - Visit your Cooking With! app
   - Try the cooking chat feature
   - Should work without any server setup!
